parallel vs async
 - 4 core thread and 10000 virtual thread.
 - in between thread communication

cocurrency
 - jitter
 - synchronus xhr
 - event loop first come first serve
 - managing cocurrency

 Inversion of control
 - The part I am controlling, the part I am not.
 - Callback no too early, fast, too many time, ...
 
 Not Resonable 
 - temproanl dependenices
 - Non local jump.

Fix
 - split Callback
 - err

 Thunk-
  - elemenate the time complexity 
  - using race condition.

Promsises-
  - Promise hell.
  - future value.
  - uninvert the inversion of control. 
  - trust 
  - only resolved once, success, error, immutable once resolved.
  - callback manager
  - flow control
  - chaining promises.
  - promise chain 

  - Promise.all | gate
  - Promise.race | whoever gets complete first

Generator
 - run to completion 
 - run to completion is not in Generator - state machine
 - pausable function.
 - localized blocking.
 - synchronus flow control.
 - inversion of control issue.
 - yeild promise
